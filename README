This is Business::OnlinePayment::OpenECHO, an Business::OnlinePayment
backend module for ECHO.  It is only useful if you have a merchant account
with ECHO: http://www.echo-inc.com/  (also see http://www.openecho.com/)

This module is based on code written by Michael Lehmkuhl
<michael@electricpulp.com>, with special thanks to Jim Darden
<jdarden@echo-inc.com> and Dan Browning <db@kavod.com>.  It was adapted to
the Business::OnlinePayment API by Ivan Kohler <ivan-openecho@420.am>.

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments through
online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (If you
like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
solution").
