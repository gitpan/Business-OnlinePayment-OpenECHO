	- Include final 0.02 changelog
	- Actually bump the version number this time
	- Switch from GET to POST, as per old 1.5 prerelease from Michael
	  Lehmkuhl <michael@electricpulp.com> 
	- Don't check expiration for ECHECK and refunds
	- For the unsupported "void" action, return is_success 0 and error
	  msg suggesting "credit" action, instead of croaking.  This way the
	  "try void first, if it fails, try credit" idiom will work.
	- tests: enable check.t and add crypt_check.t and {crypt_}bad_check.t
	- update with new test account
	- s/CHECK/ECHECK/, DOH
	- move "payee" to a new() option, that makes more sense?
	- use '00000000' for check # if one is missing then.  what else to do
	  for recurring transactions?
